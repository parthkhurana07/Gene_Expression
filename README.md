# Gene Expression

This repository contains an analysis of the effects of transitioning E. coli from anaerobic to aerobic conditions, using the Wullfen dataset. The analysis is performed in R language and makes use of libraries such as dplyr, tidyverse, GEOQuery and ggplot2.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The following R packages are required to run the analysis:
1. R
2. Rstudio
3. R libraries - dplyr, tidyverse, GEOQuery, ggplot2

## Data
The Wullfen dataset can be obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (accession number GSE71562). The data can be downloaded and loaded into R using the GEOQuery package.

## Running the analysis
The analysis is performed in the scripts/genexp.R file. The code loads the data, performs some pre-processing and manipulation, and generates plots and tables to visualize the results.
